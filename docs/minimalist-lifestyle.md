# Minimalist Living Without Asceticism: A Personal Journey

*Originally published by Little Cat Meow on Douban*
*December 2017 - February 2018*

## Introduction

Minimalism isn't about living with nothing - it's about living with what truly matters. This journey documents my experiences with balanced minimalist living over several months, showing how to maintain a simplified lifestyle while still enjoying life's pleasures.

## Daily Reflections

### February 2018

**Feb 8, 2018 - Minimalist Wedding Photography**
Today I want to share my minimalist approach to wedding photography. While the most extreme option would be not taking any photos, most couples still want to commemorate their special day. Photography studios typically offer various packages with multiple outfit changes and numerous products. However, we chose a different path.

Our approach focused on quality over quantity:
- Selected the best photographer and makeup artist
- Minimal photo retouching
- Only ordered essential items (two parent albums and one full-size portrait)
- Created DIY photo displays using branches, pinecones, and twine
  :::

**Feb 5, 2018 - Effortless Cleaning**
When friends asked about Chinese New Year cleaning plans, I realized we didn't need any special preparation - our home stays consistently clean thanks to minimalist living. Our organized spaces include:
- A full-wall cabinet in the entryway with ample storage
- Simple bedside setup with just tissues, photo clips, and aromatherapy
- Streamlined kitchen with essential cookware and ingredients

**Feb 3, 2018 - Health & Fitness Journey**
January proved successful in reaching my fitness goals:
- Weight reduced to 43kg
- Waist measurement decreased from 66cm to 61cm
- Decluttered unsuitable clothing and empty skincare products

:::note
My successful diet principles:
1. Focus on protein-rich foods
2. Reduce carbohydrates
3. Increase vegetables and fruits
4. Eat slowly and mindfully
5. Avoid snacks and sugary drinks

### January 2018

- A versatile striped sweater (replacing a difficult-to-match green top)

**Jan 14, 2018 - Fitness Milestone**
Completed four-week weight loss plan:
- Initial weight: 46.4kg

- New goal: Build muscle after reaching 43.6kg

**Jan 12, 2018 - Annual Skincare Investment**
Made my yearly SK-II purchase:

- Bought during annual sale
- Maintained brand loyalty for consistent results

**Jan 11, 2018 - Relationship Learning**
A personal story about communication and love in marriage, emphasizing the importance of expressing feelings rather than using silent treatment.

## Philosophical Approach

My understanding of minimalism differs from extreme asceticism. It's about:
- Keeping what serves a purpose
- Avoiding excessive consumerism
- Focusing on emotional connections
- Finding joy in simple pleasures
- Making thoughtful purchasing decisions

Key principles:
