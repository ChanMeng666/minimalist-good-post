# My Three Years of Minimalist Living

*Originally written by Chocolate Dog Heart from Guangdong on January 19, 2023*

## The Meaning of Minimalist Living

The true measure of a person's wealth isn't just about money or possessions - it's about our intrinsic value when everything else is stripped away. My journey into minimalism wasn't about blindly discarding possessions, but rather about thoughtful organization and meaningful use of items.

Core principles:
- Anti-consumerism
- Environmental consciousness
- Sustainability
- Personal preference

## Six Aspects of My Minimalist Life

### 1. My Color Palette

I maintain a strict color scheme of:
- Black
- White
- Gray
- Green
- Blue

:::note
These colors apply to:
- Clothing (minimal, comfort-focused)
- Decorations
- Daily items
- Digital interfaces

The palette is both personally pleasing and practically efficient, eliminating decision fatigue in styling.

### 2. Essential Electronics

Frequently used devices:
1. Laptop
2. iPad

4. Bluetooth speaker
5. Huawei P40 Pro

## Recent Reflection

:::note
A recent travel experience with friends highlighted the contrast between minimalist living and social media-driven lifestyle:
- Friends focused on constant photo-taking
- Excessive social media posting
- Limited real engagement with experiences

This reinforced my commitment to meaningful experiences over digital validation.
