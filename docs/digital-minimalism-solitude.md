# Digital Minimalism: Understanding the Power of Solitude

*Originally written by Fangzhou on July 11, 2019*

## Introduction

After a brief holiday break from digital minimalism, I've decided to return to its principles and share weekly insights from Cal Newport's book. Today, let's explore a crucial concept: Solitude.

## Understanding Solitude

### Definition
The Oxford Dictionary defines solitude as "the state of being alone, especially when you find this pleasant." However, Cal Newport presents a more nuanced definition:

:::info
"Solitude is a state of being free from input of other minds."

Key point: Solitude is less about physical environment and more about mental state.
:::

### Example
Newport illustrates this with a compelling example:
- Sitting alone by a lake like Thoreau but reading, listening to music, or watching movies is NOT solitude
- Being in a noisy restaurant but thinking independently without external input IS solitude

## The Digital Challenge

:::note
Modern challenges to solitude:
- Digital devices, especially smartphones, fill every moment of boredom
- Constant information input has become the new normal
- True solitude has become increasingly rare

### Why Lack of Solitude is Dangerous

Without solitude (receiving information without reflection), we lose the ability to:
- View issues from different perspectives
- Organize and synthesize similar viewpoints
- Evaluate how ideas align with our goals
- Process and integrate our experiences

## Practical Steps to Achieve Solitude

Newport offers specific recommendations:

### 1. Daily Phone-Free Time
- Dedicate at least 20 minutes daily away from your phone
- Examples:
    - Take walks without devices
    - Exercise without electronics
    - Create phone-free zones in your day

### 2. Long Walks

Key elements of productive walks:
- Choose quiet, scenic routes
- Focus on a complex problem
- Embrace the challenge of maintaining focus
- Use it as concentration training

## Benefits of Solitude

1. Enhanced problem-solving abilities
2. Improved focus and concentration
3. Better self-awareness
4. Reduced mental clutter
5. More original thinking
