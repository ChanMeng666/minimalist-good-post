## Preface

:::note
Before diving into methods, remember:
- Methods ("术") are secondary
- Philosophy ("道") is fundamental
- Reading without practice brings no change
- Personal experimentation is essential
  :::

## Theoretical Foundation

### Understanding Digital Minimalism

Digital minimalism means using digital tools thoughtfully and purposefully, maximizing their benefits while minimizing their invasion of real life.

### Key Theories

#### 1. The Power Imbalance Theory
:::important
You're not just facing internet products, but:
- Teams of professional technologists
- Sophisticated engagement algorithms
- Profit-driven business models

Remember: "If you're not paying for the product, you are the product."
:::

#### 2. Attention Deficit Theory
:::info
Modern digital life creates:
- Constant "online" status
- Chronic attention dispersion
- Difficulty with deep focus
- Pavlovian responses to notifications
  :::

#### 3. Time Conservation Theory
- Everyone has only 24 hours daily
- Digital activities compete with real-life activities
- Zero-sum game between online and offline life

#### 4. The "Any-Benefit" Fallacy
Don't justify tool usage merely because it provides some benefit. Consider:
- True necessity
- Overall cost-benefit ratio
- Alternative solutions

## Practical Implementation

### Method 1: Enrich Real Life
:::note
Best defense against digital addiction:
- Maintain fulfilling offline activities
- Build meaningful relationships
- Develop engaging hobbies
- Create purposeful daily schedules
  :::

### Method 2: App Management

#### Initial Screening
Before installing any app, consider:
- True necessity
- Potential addiction risk
- Time cost
- Alternative solutions

#### Phone Organization
1. Disable all non-essential notifications
2. Set specific usage time blocks
3. Create phone-free zones/times
4. Implement the two-minute rule

### Method 3: Mental Shifts

#### Purposeful Usage
Before using any device, ask:
- What's my specific purpose?
- How long will I use it?
- What will I do afterwards?

#### Mindful Engagement
- Practice the "narration method"
- Set clear start/end times
- Maintain usage awareness

## Personal Reflections

:::important
Key lessons learned:
1. Change is gradual
2. Perfection isn't the goal
3. Setbacks are normal
4. Progress over perfection
5. Real life over digital convenience

## Conclusion

As Thoreau said:
>"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. They honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. Yet the day is always new, and our whole life still unexplored."

Never too late to start. Let's reclaim our attention and life together.

:::note
Remember: Digital minimalism isn't about complete rejection of technology, but about thoughtful and intentional use that enriches rather than diminishes our real lives.
