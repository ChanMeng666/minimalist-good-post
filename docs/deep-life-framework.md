# Deep Questions #7: How to Build a Deep Life

*Originally written by Fangzhou on July 12, 2020*

## Introduction

Q: How can I get my life back on track? I often feel lazy, unmotivated, overthink things, and feel lost.

A: The deep life framework can help you find yourself again. It consists of five core elements:
- Craft
- Constitution
- Community
- Contemplation
- Competency

## The Deep Life Framework

### 1. Craft

Key aspects of craft:
- Essential for making a living
- A means to impact the world
- Lifelong importance

As emphasized in "So Good They Can't Ignore You," greater mastery of your craft leads to greater career control. The key is finding satisfaction in the process of skill development itself.

### 2. Constitution

Physical and mental health deserve equal attention:
- Monitor diet and exercise
- Take a radical approach
- Push beyond conventional boundaries

Being slightly radical in health practices:
- Signals serious commitment
- Generates genuine enjoyment
- Builds confidence
- Develops patience
- Creates satisfaction

### 3. Community

Community connects you with others:
- Focus on being useful to your community/family/school/city
- Don't focus on making others your friends
- Build connections through contribution and sacrifice

Deep human connections:
