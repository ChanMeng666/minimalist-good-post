# Six Tips to Break Phone Addiction

*Originally written by Sishu on November 14, 2021*

## The Information Diet Principle

Just as we care about our dietary health, we should be mindful of what our brains "consume." This awareness can help us make better choices about our digital consumption habits.

## Six Practical Tips

### 1. Quality Over Quantity
- Be selective about information sources
- Avoid platforms with low-quality content
- Skip short-video apps
- Limit social media usage to essential platforms

### 2. Simplify App Functions
- Use WeChat solely for communication
- Keep Alipay strictly for payments
- Use Taobao only for necessary purchases
- Avoid exploring additional features, especially information feeds

### 3. Use Web Versions
- Access services through web browsers instead of apps
- Use mini-programs for specific functions
- Reduce the temptation to mindlessly browse

### 4. Minimize Notifications
- Turn off notifications for non-essential apps
- Keep only crucial messaging apps (e.g., WeChat, QQ)
- Disable sounds and vibrations

### 5. Clean Home Screen
- Implement drawer mode
- Keep home screen clear of apps
- Reduce visual triggers for phone use

### 6. Active Information Seeking
- Search for information intentionally
- Avoid passive consumption through algorithmic feeds
- Take control of your information intake
