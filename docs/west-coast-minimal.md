## Mindful Consumption

### Breaking the Shopping Addiction
The essence of minimalism isn't just about discarding items, but about freeing ourselves from material attachments and finding genuine contentment.

:::note Psychology of Shopping
Shopping often acts as a "strong stimulus behavior" - providing immediate gratification similar to short-form videos. Like any addictive behavior, it creates a cycle of temporary happiness followed by the need for more purchases.
:::

### Alternative Sources of Happiness
Instead of seeking joy through purchases, focus on:
1. Regular exercise
2. Developing hobbies
3. Maintaining a quality lifestyle

## Practical Minimalism Tips

### Before Purchase Checklist
1. Is it something I truly need?
2. Can I afford it?
3. Does it spark joy?
4. Can it be borrowed or substituted?
5. Do I have space for it?

:::tip Return Policies in America
- Amazon: 30-day unconditional returns
- Sephora: 180-day unconditional returns
- IKEA: 1-year unconditional returns
- Nordstrom: Lifetime free returns
  These policies greatly support minimalist lifestyle practices.
