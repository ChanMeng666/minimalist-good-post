# My Practical Tips for Digital Detox

*Originally written by Liu Shao Jack on April 21, 2021*

## The Wake-up Call

A few years ago, I went to the Guangzhou Library without my phone. I spent the entire afternoon reading physical books in a quiet corner. That experience made me realize it was the first time in years I had engaged in uninterrupted, immersive reading for several hours. Before smartphones became ubiquitous, such deep reading sessions were common for me.

That afternoon became a turning point, prompting me to examine my reading habits and our suffocating relationship with the internet. While the internet makes information access convenient, perhaps we need to moderate our usage for a more balanced life.

## The Silicon Valley Paradox

:::note
Interestingly, many Silicon Valley tech leaders strictly limit their children's access to technology:
:::

- Steve Jobs prohibited his children from using iPads and phones in their bedrooms
- Bill Gates banned phones for his children until age 14 and restricted screen time before bedtime
- Chris Anderson, former editor of WIRED magazine and a tech CEO, believes screens are closer to cocaine than candy in terms of addiction potential. His family rules include:
    1. No social media until age 13
    2. Phones only allowed in summer before high school
    3. No screens in bedrooms
    4. Content filtering enabled
    5. Absolutely no iPads
    6. Strict screen time schedules enforced through Google WiFi

## My Six Strategies for Digital Detox

### 1. Minimize Social Media Usage

The product managers' success at social media companies often correlates with our life's failure. Here's how I manage social media:

a) **Deactivate Unnecessary Accounts**
- Keep only essential social media accounts
- Uninstall apps that don't add value
- Subscribe to news accounts instead of browsing social platforms

b) **Remove Social Apps from Phone**
- Use separate work and personal messaging accounts
- Set specific times for checking messages
- Keep social interactions within defined time windows

### 2. Scheduled Internet Disconnection

I protect my golden hours (5 AM to 12 PM) by:
- Setting automatic phone shutdown from 11 PM to 12 PM next day
- Using a basic backup phone with minimal apps for essential functions
- Focusing on high-value activities during peak productivity hours

### 3. Phone-Free Days

Designate specific days (weekends or holidays) as phone-free days:
- Carry only books or e-readers
- Focus on face-to-face interactions
- Experience life without digital distractions
- Use a basic backup phone if navigation is necessary

### 4. No-Phone Social Interactions

Maintain a strict no-phone policy during:
- Family gatherings
- Meals with friends
- Business meetings
- Date nights

### 5. Embrace the Real World

- Choose outdoor running over treadmill Netflix sessions
- Engage with natural environments
- Exercise eyes through varied focal distances
- Prefer real-world experiences over digital alternatives

### 6. Annual Digital Detox Retreat

Take a week-long digital detox at year's end:
- No phones or computers
- Use only notebook and pen
- Find a quiet place for reflection
- Review the year and plan ahead
