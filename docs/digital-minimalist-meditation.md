# Digital Minimalist's Daily Practice: Meditation and Focus

*Originally written by Fangzhou on July 29, 2019*

## Introduction

Most meditation practitioners and Buddhists practice mindfulness meditation. While it may seem mysterious, it's actually accessible to everyone.

## Basic Practice Guidelines

### Initial Approach
"Start with just five minutes. Simply sit and refrain from responding to any physical demands or external influences. Whatever enters your mind, just observe it. Mundane thoughts, like stains in a toilet bowl - whatever appears, just observe it, nothing more."

### Two Key Rules

:::important
1. Daily Five-Minute Practice
- Minimum five minutes per session
- Track towards 300 total hours
- Only count sessions of five minutes or longer
- Accumulate minutes progressively

2. Long-Term Commitment
- Don't complete 300 hours within three months
- Spread practice over 1-2 years minimum
- Consistency matters more than quantity
  :::

## Personal Observations

After several days of practice, I've noticed:

1. Mental Activity Awareness
- Discovered the abundance of thoughts in my mind
- Learned to observe myself objectively
- Practice watching thoughts without judgment

2. Improved Focus
- Reduced mental noise
- Enhanced concentration
- Greater mental clarity

Remember: The value lies not in the duration but in the consistency of practice. Start with five minutes and maintain it regularly rather than attempting longer sessions sporadically.
