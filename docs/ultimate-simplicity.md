# The Ultimate Simplicity

*Originally written by Taiyu on September 19, 2017*

## Living with Balanced Minimalism

Recently, I've adopted a more balanced approach to minimalism. Instead of strict rules, I've found a natural rhythm that works for my family life:

- I buy toys for my baby when needed
- I purchase clothes that I like
- I've learned to accept some minor disorder at home

However, I still maintain core minimalist principles:
- Immediately dispose of unnecessary items
- Remove unwanted snacks and food
- Strictly avoid buying impractical things for our home

While I wanted to write more updates, my baby keeps climbing all over me, making it challenging to focus! In my free moments, I enjoy doing some handicrafts and occasional flower arrangements.
