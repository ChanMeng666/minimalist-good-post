## Design Philosophy

Our home embodies our minimalist ideals:

- No unnecessary objects
- Everything has its purpose and place
- Clean, open spaces for children to play freely

## Room-by-Room Tour

### Living Area
- No traditional sofa or coffee table
- No TV (using projector on white wall)
- Open space for children's activities
- Large mirror to enhance spaciousness
- Raised platform with tatami mats for relaxation

:::tip Family Time
The open layout allows our children to skate and play freely while we can enjoy family movie nights using the projector.
