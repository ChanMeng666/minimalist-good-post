# Two Years of Minimalism: My Transformation Journey

*Originally written by Li Qingyue on May 12, 2022*

## Introduction

I first discovered minimalism through the "Minimalist Living" group on Douban. Seeing others' clean, uncluttered homes inspired me to start my own journey. After nearly two years of practice since 2020, here's my reflection on the changes.

## Before Minimalism

### 1. "Nothing to Wear" Syndrome
:::note
Common issues:
- Overstuffed, messy closet
- Nothing suitable for important occasions
- Constant shopping but never satisfied
- Trapped in a "buy → dislike → buy more" cycle
  :::

### 2. Room Management Struggles
- Small rental room packed with items
- New bedroom's window sill and vanity constantly cluttered
- Clean-ups lasted less than a week

### 3. Digital Clutter
- Phone constantly running out of storage
- Unused apps taking up space
- Overwhelming WeChat messages and chat history
- Excessive similar photos

### 4. Mental State
- Scattered attention while multitasking
- False sense of efficiency
- Constant anxiety about work and relationships
- Self-doubt and questioning life's value

## After Two Years of Minimalism

### 1. Home Organization
:::info
Visitor feedback: "Yours is the cleanest, most organized home I've visited"

Key maintenance principles:
- Focus on utility over aesthetics
- Everything has its designated place
- Daily "return items to their place" habit
- Immediate handling of laundry
- Daily bed-making routine
- Nightly house check
  :::

### 2. Wardrobe Management
- Donated clothes unworn for two years
- Disposed of damaged items
- Follow "one in, one out" rule
- Focus on "fewer but better" items
- Avoid similar pieces
- Maintain only frequently worn favorites

### 3. Digital Organization
- Regular photo backup to Aliyun
- Periodic local storage cleanup
- Minimal WeChat contacts and groups
- Delete unused apps immediately after use
- Quiet, notification-free phone

### 4. Emotional Benefits
:::note
Key improvements:
- "Less is more, slow is fast" mindset
- Better able to stay present
- Reduced emotional drain
- More self-awareness
- Less influenced by others' opinions
  :::

### 5. Time Management
- Relaxed morning routine
- Better work focus
- Single-tasking
- Meaningful evening activities (7 PM to midnight):
    - Exercise
    - Reading
    - Drawing
    - Gaming with spouse

## Reflection

My college roommate once said, "You're good at surviving but not at living." Now, through minimalism, I've finally discovered what living means to me. Minimalism has brought order to my life and taught me to appreciate and love living.

Future Goals:
- Continue developing inner freedom
- Resist external definitions
- Maintain emotional balance
