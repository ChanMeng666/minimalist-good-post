# Six Months of Minimalism: A Proud Achievement

*Originally written by Coco on May 23, 2022*

## Introduction

Today, while organizing my belongings, I couldn't help but feel proud of my achievement in minimalism. The saying "Life at its finest is simple and pure" resonated with me years ago, but only now has it become my chosen lifestyle for the future.

:::info
My Journey Phases:
1. Initial desire to own nothing
2. Guilt with every purchase
3. Current state: Minimal desires, buying only necessities
   :::

## Personal Philosophy

The process has been slow but healing. Minimalism requires time for adaptation, especially for mental preparation. Moving too quickly can lead to rebounds. While some have practiced minimalism for years with refined mindsets, I'm content with my current progress.

Key Principles:
- "Less is more, slow is fast"
- Comfort in current state is priority
- Minimalism should be diverse for different lifestyles
