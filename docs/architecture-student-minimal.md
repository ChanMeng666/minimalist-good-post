# Minimalist Life as an Architecture Student

*Originally written by Sylvia, a third-year architecture student, September 15, 2017*

## Introduction

As a third-year architecture student at a Chinese art academy, I've been practicing minimalism for quite some time. The biggest benefit I've experienced is the overall lightness in both body and mind.

Key benefits of minimalist living as an architecture student:
- Better space management
- Reduced physical and mental clutter
- Improved focus on essential tasks
- Enhanced productivity
  :::

## Academic Life Management

### Project Storage
Before embracing minimalism, my dorm room was cluttered with drawings and models. Now:
- Keep only digital copies of work
- Focus on portfolio preparation
- View assignments as learning checkpoints rather than permanent artifacts

### Textbook Strategy
- Return professional course books home after completion
- Discard general course materials post-exam
- Use Kindle for most reading
- Subscribe to Amazon's monthly e-book service (Â¥12/month)

:::note
For specialized architecture books like portfolios and visual collections, I maintain physical copies, but all other books are digital.

## Living Space Organization

### Dorm Room Philosophy
- Resist the urge to create extra storage spaces
- Limited storage means controlled purchasing
- Under-bed storage contains only:
    - One pair of flip-flops
    - One pair of black leather shoes
    - One pair of black sneakers
    - One pair of white canvas shoes

### Daily Essentials for Class
- Phone
- Keys
- Lipstick
- Card holder
- Notebook
- Small mirror
- Pencil case
- Sketching pad
- MUJI tote bag

:::info
Practical tip: During project submission weeks, makeup is simplified to just lipstick for a quick refresh between long work sessions.
:::

## Wardrobe Management

Current wardrobe consists of 30 pieces (excluding sleepwear and underwear):
- Quality over quantity approach
- Focus on versatile pieces
- Example: A three-year-old silk blouse that works for multiple seasons

:::note
Clothing care tip: Hand wash quality pieces with shampoo suds in a basin. Good clothes deserve proper care.

## Digital Organization

### Computer Setup
- High-performance desktop for architecture software (3DS Max, CAD, PS, AI)
- External hard drive for portability
- Computer contains only essential software
- All files categorized and stored on external drive:
    - Architecture references
    - Personal works
    - Photos
    - Videos

### Document Management
- Important receipts preserved
- Non-essential documents digitized
- Handwritten notes for personal reflection and creativity

## Health and Wellness

Recent updates:
- Regular running routine
- Height: 163cm
- Weight maintained at 48kg through mindful eating
- Focus on fresh foods
- Limited snacking
- Digital note-taking using Evernote

## Travel Experience

Recent field trip to Yunnan mountains:
- Single backpack approach
- Essential clothing that mix and match
- Versatile jeans as a staple
- Comfortable sneakers
- Foldable tote bag for convenience
