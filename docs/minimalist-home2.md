# Home Tour: Two Years of Minimalist Living

*Originally shared by Mr. Han from Urumqi on May 29, 2022*

## Living Experience

After nearly two years of living in this home, I've developed some insights about maintaining a minimalist living space. When I first moved in, I focused on acquiring essential appliances and household items. However, with a principle of maintaining quality without compromising basic needs, I found that subsequent purchasing needs virtually disappeared.
