## Core Principles

### 1. Technology Should Serve You

Your devices and apps should be tools that help you achieve your goals, not distractions that pull you away from what matters. Consider:

- Is this tool adding real value to my life?
- Am I using it intentionally?
- Could I achieve the same goals with fewer digital tools?

### 2. Quality Over Quantity

Instead of having:
- 5 messenger apps
- 3 cloud storage services
- Multiple email accounts

Choose:
✓ One primary communication platform
✓ One cloud solution
✓ Consolidated email management
```

### 3. Digital Decluttering Process

1. **Audit Your Digital Life**
    - List all your digital tools and services
    - Track your screen time
    - Note your usage patterns

2. **Digital Detox**
    - Remove non-essential apps
    - Unsubscribe from unnecessary emails
    - Clean up your digital storage

    - Carefully evaluate each tool before bringing it back
    - Set clear rules for usage
    - Establish boundaries
